In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to cluster the customers of a grocery store based on their purchase records. I used Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize and explore the data. I also performed feature engineering to extract useful information from the data and simplify it for clustering. I reduced the dimensionality of the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as it had many redundant features that could affect the analysis and clustering. I chose Agglomerative Clustering as the clustering algorithm, as it can capture the hierarchical structure of the data and produce meaningful clusters.
